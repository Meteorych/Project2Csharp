# There will be several C# projects
All of them are tasks given by my mentor.
## Time i've spent for each project 
- _NET01.1_ — 2.5 hours.
- _NET02.1_ — 7 or 8 hours.
- _NET01.2_ — 4 hours.
- _NET02.2_ — 8(?) hours.
- _NET02.3_ — 8 hours (Attributes, Logging, Reflection)
- _NET02.4_ — 5 hours (Multi-Thread app, Architecture should be fixed, user should have more control over the program)

## Used during the development of projects
* For testing: _MSTest_, _XUnit_, _Moq_.
* For logging: _NLog_.
* During main program work: _DocumentFormat.OpenXML_, _FileSystemWatcher_.
